        This project was born out of a desire to create an "easy to use" yet efficient financial securities tool. Aleks has had experience working in Financial Services, and after
        observing analysts complain about the bloated feeling of the apps they were using, he decided that he would create a tool that would get rid of the
        unnecessary content other programs often include.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Jim felt that many of the programs that financial analysts used were lacking one thing: an attention to detail. He constantly
          strives to find new patterns and methods for designing user-friendly software programs, and thus this is yet another one of his creations.

        <p>
          While we have made great progress on our program, at the time of writing, we have yet to accomplish some of the features we wanted to build by
            end of the semester. We plan on continuing to add to this application even after the conclusion of the Fall 2020 semester, and here is a list of what we
            plan on mplementing.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              An option for the user to download (in XML and JSON format) their securities.
              </li>
            <li>
              Allow the user to access their list of stocks from the website (and display an XML representation of their securities).
              </li>
            <li>
              Guest Mode (originally was included but had to be cut due to numerous issues :( )
              </li>
            </ul>
