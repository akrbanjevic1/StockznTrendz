# StockznTrendz
An application built to display information regarding the Simple Moving Average for various securities. Our applications allows users to compare the SMA for 2 different periods (50 and 200 days), and it even has the ability to recommend to the user what their next move should be. Using the power of PyQt5, our project was designed using a "simple and modern" design philosophy; resulting in an easy to use application. In addition to the application, our project has a very useful informational website. On this website, users have the ability to not only learn more about the inspiration for this project, but they also have the chance to view the very research that was done in order to create this application.

Current Features:
-Login and Registration Support
-Saving of securities (up to 3) for easier reference
-Saving of the SMA graph for a given security

Planned features:
-Saving more than just 3 securities
-Logging in from the informational website
-Further design changes
-Guest Mode (allowing users to view trends without creating an account)
